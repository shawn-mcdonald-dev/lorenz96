# Lorenz96 ML Surrogate Modeling

This repository explores the use of machine learning to approximate the dynamics of the Lorenz96 (L96) system ‚Äî a simplified yet chaotic model originally developed to capture essential features of atmospheric behavior.

L96 is widely used as a testbed for studying chaos and predictability, making it an ideal stepping stone toward more complex domains such as weather forecasting, energy systems, and other nonlinear dynamical systems.
